# shell-scripts
a collection of shell scripts I make. They can be for any purpse. As long as I think they can be useful for other people, I'll have it here.

## The scripts:
### getMsFontsIso.sh
This script is to help and automate the process of extracting and installing fonts from a windows 10 iso.
### menu_pw_devices.py
This is a python script, (shell was too hard) that uses a menu program (dmenu/bemenu in my case) to let you change the default speaker using PipeWire.
